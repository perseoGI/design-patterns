# Creational Design Patterns

## Why don't just use new?

- Hide which concrete classes are instantiated
- How those objects are created and put together


|Pattern             |  Description                                           | 
|:------------------:|--------------------------------------------------------|
| Singleton          | Ensure only one instance                               |
| Factory Method     | Create instance without depending on its concrete type |
| Object Pool        | Reuse existing instances                               |
| Abstract Factory   | Create instances from a specific family                |
| Prototype          | Clone existing objects from a prototype                |
| Builder            | Construct a complex object step by step                |
